# E-Commerce Coffee Shop Sales Analysis

## Overview

The dashboard provides key insights into transaction metrics, revenue trends, peak sales periods, and performance by coffee type, time of day, day of week, and month. The data covers transactions from **March 2024 to March 2025**, focusing on various coffee products and sales patterns.

The project is designed to help understand customer behavior, optimize inventory, and identify growth opportunities in an online coffee retail business.
